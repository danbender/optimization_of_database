# Welcome to KarmaVille

A pre-built Rails application with two models: `User` and `KarmaPoint`. After seeding the database with data, you'll have 100,000 rows in the `users` table and 1,500,000 rows in the `karma_points` table. The index page is sl-o-o-ow; it takes several seconds to load.

The goal is to speed it up without using any fancy technologies like memcache, redis, or Rails' fragment caching.


## Getting Started

KarmaVille uses [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/).  Run the following commands to get started:

```text
$ rake db:setup
```
The `rake db:setup` command could take several minutes to run.


## Result

Rewrote some really expensive Active Record queries and added a [database index](http://rakeroutes.com/blog/increase-rails-performance-with-database-indexes/) to the user_id in the karma table. Wrote own Rake Task to calculate the total sum of a userâ€™s karma points and store it in the database.

Now, the index page loads in <4w0ms.
